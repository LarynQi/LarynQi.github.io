Bonus Question (you can skip this and come back to it later if you have time)

Did you notice how picky Eaters and regular Eaters have different ways to choose their preferred ice cream?
How about instead of using an instance attribute to keep track of whether an Eater is picky,
create a subclass of the Eater class called PickyEater?

i) Which method(s) would you have to override in the PickyEater class?
You only have to override choose in the PickyEater class.

ii) Do we need to have the parameter picky in the __init__ method for Eater? What about for PickyEater?
Depending on how you implement the code, it is possible to eliminate the picky parameter completely.

iii) Try to write the code from scratch below. You can re-write parts of the existing code.
See below for sample code response.

# Modify __init__ and choose methods in Eater class

    def __init__(self, name, appetite, favorite):
